PointOfSales
============
This is a sample application which grows from test assignment I got on one of interviews. Goal was to build a small service that can be used in one of physical stores for handling the sale from start to finish (except financial transactions). I was given a prioritized backlog of following user stories:

 #  | Description
------------- | :-------------
1  | As a user I want to be able to see all available products.
2  | As a user I want to be able to search for a product.
3  | As a user I want to be able to see the available sales combinations when selecting a product.
4  | As a user I want to be able to add a product to an order.
5  | As a user I want to be able to add a product with sales combinations to an order.
6  | As a user I want to be able to add multiple products or sales combinations to an order.
7  | As a user I want to be able to enter the details of a customer in the system.
8  | As a user I want to be able to search for recurring customers.
9  | As a user I want to be able to handle purchases for recurring customers.
10 | As a user I want to be able to view the purchase history of a customer.
11 | As a user I want to be able to e-mail an invoice to a customer.
12 | As a user I want to be able to edit the detials of a customer.

Non-functional requirement was to use Web API. I was new to this technology, so I decided to get in touch with it and build this sample application. Another thing I practiced here is outside-in development guided with Specflow acceptance tests. Also you can find usage of Dapper micro ORM, Ninject, NLog, Moq and xUnit (previously I used NUnit).

Business value is delivered, but work is still in progress.
